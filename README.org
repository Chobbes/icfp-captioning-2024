* Introduction

This repository contains the word lists for the ICFP 2023
conference. There are directories for each day.

The word lists contain a lot of junk right now, but they are sorted in
a hopefully helpful order!

- Any authors and institutions appear first
- Words that exist in our ICFP glossary appear next
- Unclassified words (words that don't appear in our glossary)  appear last
- Within these categories the words are sorted by the number of
  occurrences within the paper.

There is also a glossary.csv file in the main directory. This contains
a huge list of words that are known to have occurred in ICFPs in the
past.
