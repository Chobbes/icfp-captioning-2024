* Introduction

This repository contains the word lists for the ICFP 2024
conference. There are directories for each day.

The word lists contain a lot of junk right now, but they are sorted in
a hopefully helpful order!

- Any authors and institutions appear first
  + The authors in the words list includes all authors that are referenced in the paper.
  + Check the authors.txt / affiliations.txt for actual authors of the talk
- Words that exist in our ICFP glossary appear next
- Unclassified words (words that don't appear in our glossary)  appear last
- Within these categories the words are sorted by the number of
  occurrences within the paper.
